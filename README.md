## Notes
 -Using useReducer to prevent bugs because of project size 
 
 -The useReducer hook in React is a way to manage state in your components. It's similar to the useState hook, but it allows you to manage more complex state objects and interactions.

Imagine a football game: the state of the game is constantly changing, with new plays being run and new scores being scored. The useReducer hook is like the coach, calling the plays and deciding how the game should progress based on the current state.

In the same way, the useReducer hook allows you to define a reducer function that determines how state should be updated based on the current state and an action that is dispatched. The reducer function is like the playbook, containing all of the rules and logic for how the state should change in response to different actions.

Using the useReducer hook, you can manage the state of your React components in a more flexible and powerful way, allowing you to handle more complex interactions and update your state in response to a wider range of actions.
